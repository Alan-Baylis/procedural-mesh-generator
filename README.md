project goals:
-simplify and streamline procedural generation and modification of meshes to the point where it is easy to use and versatile (at least create, modify, and selective extrude)
-apply procedural generation to the design of complex objects, in order to create more immersive assets (eg. generate pipes or wiring that make sense in the world as a whole)
-use empty objects to specify generation locations (eg. rubble spot, pipe connection) and give generated assets physics (temporary or permanent) to ground them when needed
