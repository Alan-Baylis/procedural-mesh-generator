# procedural-mesh-generator  
Project goals:  
-simplify and streamline procedural generation and modification of meshes to the point where it is easy to use and versatile (at least create, modify, and selective extrude)  
-apply procedural generation to the design of complex objects, in order to create more immersive assets (eg. generate pipes or wiring dynamically)  
-use empty objects to specify generation locations (eg. rubble spot, pipe connection) and use raycasts to ground them when needed
